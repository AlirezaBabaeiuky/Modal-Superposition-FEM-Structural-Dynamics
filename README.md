# Modal-Superposition-FEM-Structural-Dynamics
In this repository, modal analysis along with transient (time-domain) response of a beam element is studied. 
Modal superposition method is adopted via finite element numerical method to find the modal and transient response of a beam. Results are also compared against Direct Integration Method. 
Excitation type is considered as sinusoidal. Assumption also encomapss the linearity of the system so that superposition princilpe holds validity.
